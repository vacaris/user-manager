# User Manager

An easy app to manage users, just to practice

## Tech
Backend: Python (Flask, JWT, SQLAlchemy)
Frontend: React
Database: SQLite

## Features

Register and log in with JWTs 
Role-based access
Search & pagination, because scrolling is exhausting
works locally (and nowhere else now)

# PS

Admin must be created manually first, I donâ€™t trust users with that power
All requests need a valid JWT, because I take security very seriously
